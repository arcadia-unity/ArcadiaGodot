ArcadiaGodot
=======
The integration of the Clojure Programming Language with the Godot game engine. This is an adaptation of [Arcadia](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia/).

Status
------
ArcadiaGodot is at a 1.0 release and the existing API should not change.

Community
---------
- [Gittr/IRC](https://gitter.im/arcadia-unity/Arcadia)


Setup
----------
You'll need a version of [Godot with Mono](https://godotengine.org/download) and `MSBuild` (see the Requirements section on the download page).

- Start Godot
- Create new project
- Create new scene
- Attach new C# script which inherits from spatial and uses template default to scene
- Save both the script and scene
- Open `Project -> Export...`
- Add export preset with button `Add...` at the top
- Confirm export with button `Export Project` at bottom
- `Build` button should be visible in top right corner of main window now
- Clone `ArcadiaGodot` repo into project root
- 
- Add to `{project}.csproj`:

```xml
     <ItemGroup>
       <Reference Include="ArcadiaGodot/Infrastructure/**/*.dll"></Reference>
     </ItemGroup>
```

 File should look like this now:
```xml
   <Project Sdk="Godot.NET.Sdk/3.2.3">
     <PropertyGroup>
       <TargetFramework>net472</TargetFramework>
     </PropertyGroup>
     <ItemGroup>
       <Reference Include="ArcadiaGodot/Infrastructure/**/*.dll"></Reference>
     </ItemGroup>
   </Project>
```

- Drag `ArcadiaGodot/ArcadiaHook.cs` onto the `Spatial` entry in scene list
- Click on play button
- Select main scene when prompted

- Output should say "Arcadia loaded!"

There should also be a message that says what directory is being watched for changes in `.clj` files and a couple more regarding the ports that the diverse repls are listening on.

Usage
-----

### ArcadiaHook.cs

While working in the editor, the `ArcadiaHook` script lets you connect Godot's [callbacks](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_continued.html#overridable-functions) to clojure functions.

![godot-hooks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2467644/32961551-f5a26e12-cb96-11e7-88cb-6805067b3ec0.png)

Note that these fns will be called with the *parent* of the `ArcadiaHook` instance as the first argument (the `ArcadiaHook` script inherits `Node` and would prevent manipulating any non `Node` properties on it's own node).  For example if you are manipulating a camera you would attach the hook as a child like so:

### Hooks

You can hook functions to Godot nodes in clojure with `hook+` and `hook-`.  This has the same usage as `Arcadia`'s hooks. Godot's hook types are `:enter-tree :exit-tree :ready :process :physics-process :input :unhandled-input`.

```clj
;add a anonymous hook function to the player's _Input method
(hook+ (find-node "player") :input :bar-key (fn [o k e] (log "input event:" e)))

;remove a hook fn on the menu node
(hook- (find-node "menu") :ready :my-key)
```

### Signals

[Signals](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.html) are Godot's system for events. `arcadia.core` contains functions for working with signals: `connect`, `disconnect`, `connected?`, `add-signal`, and `emit`.

`(connect (find-node "Button") "pressed" (fn [] (log "button was pressed!")))`

Most built in nodes emit a range of useful signals (like buttons being pressed, physics collisions). If you connect a var (like `#'game.core/handle-newgame`) you will be able to redefine the function in the repl.

### REPL

ArcadiaGodot has an nRepl (port 3722), a socket repl (port 5571) and an UDP repl (port 11211). See [Arcadia](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia/) for editor setup options.  Repls can be disabled or given other ports via a `{project}/configuration.edn` file.

For quick access try `telnet localhost 5571`.

### Exports

After building your project you'll need to manually compile your clojure namespaces into the build directory:

```
(require 'arcadia.internal.compiler)
(arcadia.internal.compiler/aot "export/dlls" ['selfsame.core])
```

The entire dependency tree for the given namespaces will be compiled as well.

Note: the path must allready exist. You can place dlls in the root build directory or a folder named "dlls".


## Differences from Arcadia Unity

Notable Arcadia features missing from ArcadiaGodot:

* package manager 
* Editor side clojure environment
* reader literals and object serialization
